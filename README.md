# 🐄 Volta Greentech 

## 📖 Story behind the project
During the summer of 2020 I developed the website for Volta Greentech, a startup that is reducing methane emissions from cows. 

I also built Volta's [first website](https://github.com/johan-akerman/OldVoltaGreentech) and designed their brand identity during the summer of 2019. The goal of the first website was to give a professional look to Volta to attract the media, investors and potential employees. The first website ended up getting really slow, not very SEO friendly and it was not scalable for further development. 

Therefore, I rebuilt it and created a scalable component and design system. As a result, I managed to reduce the loading time by 59% (from 3.4s to 1.4s) mainly by optimizing images with the help of a Gatsby lazy loading plugins.
