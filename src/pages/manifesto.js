          Volta Greentech’s mission is to reduce methane emissions from cows.
          The methane gas cows release through enteric fermentation equals 4% of
          the world’s total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e). This
          is 2x more emissions than from the world’s fleet of airplanes. Methane
          emissions from enteric fermentation is the single largest source of
          greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.
          <br /> <br />
          Humans have made cows a central part of the food system and there are
          today around 1 billion cows on the planet who feed a significant part
          of the human population of 8 billion people. It’s a global debate
          around the role of the cow and of what the future should look like. We
          encourage this debate and hope it leads to positive change, as how we
          live as humans today has severe negative consequences on the health of
          the planet, other living beings and our own health.
          <br /> <br />
          At Volta Greentech, we don’t know what the future of food will look
          like, if the role of the cows will be as large a part of agriculture
          as it is today or if the number of cows will increase or decrease. The
          complexity makes it difficult even for the leading researchers in the
          world to come to an agreement of what the food system should look
          like.
          <br /> <br />
          What we do know is that there are 1 billion cows in the world today
          that vastly contribute to warming the planet. And we are in a global
          climate crisis that will soon be irreversible. With our solution of
          feeding a daily supplement of natural red seaweed we can more or less
          eliminate enteric methane emissions from a cow.
          <br /> <br />
          Doing this at a large scale, fast enough to make a positive impact on
          the climate, is not going to be easy. But it’s important that it gets
          done, and that we do it in parallel to other initiatives within the
          food and agriculture sector that drive positive change for the
          climate, the wellbeing of animals and for human health.
          <br /> <br />
          Over a 20 year period, methane has a global warming potential 81x that
          of CO2. Bringing down methane emissions from cows is absolutely
          essential to limit global warming to the 1.5C target. Just like we
          have catalytic converters for cars to reduce key pollutants by 90-99%,
          our solution works as a catalytic converter for cows, radically
          reducing methane emissions.
          <br /> <br />
          Our solution to reduce methane emissions from cows is generally
          well-recognized for its potential to have a rapid, measurable and
          positive impact on reducing global warming. From time to time the
          purpose of our work gets questioned. Some argue that by working on
          reducing methane emissions from cows, we support and enable the
          continued existence of an industry, or a part of the food system, that
          some think should cease to exist because of the negative environmental
          consequences and suffering of farm animals. It’s a very valid concern
          and it’s one that has been on top of our minds from the start.
          <br /> <br />
          With our consumer brand LOME (Low Methane) we are part of influencing
          what people choose to eat. LOME was not part of our initial plan. We
          focused on seaweed production, product development and to find ways to
          partner with existing beef and dairy brands to implement our solution
          to reduce emissions. We learned that the industry will not decide on
          reducing emissions if there are no incentives and no push by consumers
          or legislators. And there will be no push by consumers or legislators
          if there is no brand leading the way showing it is possible. A
          classical chicken and egg problem. We therefore had to create LOME to
          act as the catalyst of getting consumers and legislators to see that
          it is possible to reduce emissions from beef and dairy. With LOME we
          hope to inspire consumers that they have the power with their choices
          to improve how food is produced.
          <br /> <br />
          This puts an enormous responsibility on our shoulders.
          <br /> <br />
          Firstly, we have a responsibility to make sure LOME is only attracting
          consumers who would otherwise consume conventional, non-methane
          reduced beef or dairy. We don’t want LOME to be used as an argument to
          increase consumption of beef and dairy as we believe that LOME almost
          always has a higher environmental footprint than plant-based
          alternatives.
          <br /> <br />
          Secondly, we need to choose beef and dairy partners very carefully and
          only work with the people in the industry that are at the forefront of
          working with sustainable practices and improved animal welfare. If we
          enable reduction of methane emissions but at the same time through
          LOME support bad practices we would again have failed our mission.
          <br /> <br />
          Thirdly, we need to make sure our own work of producing marine red
          seaweed is done with as low environmental footprint as possible.
          <br /> <br />
          In all these areas we will always need to improve. They will be on top
          of our minds to make sure our solution to reduce methane emissions
          from the agriculture sector truly makes a significant positive impact
          not only on the climate but on the food system as a whole.
          <br /> <br />
          We’re currently in what scientists call Code Red for humanity. The
          world needs to aggressively and rapidly bring down climate emissions,
          using all the tools in the toolbox. We will do our part, by targeting
          to eliminate the 4% of the greenhouse gas emissions that emanate from
          cows. We don’t have all the answers, but we believe that significantly
          reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cows is the right thing to do.
